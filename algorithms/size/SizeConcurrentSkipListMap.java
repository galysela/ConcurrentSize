     * This class implements a tree-like two-dimensionally linked skip
     * list in which the index levels are represented in separate
     * nodes from the base nodes holding data.  There are two reasons
     * for taking this approach instead of the usual array-based
     * structure: 1) Array based implementations seem to encounter
     * more complexity and overhead 2) We can use cheaper algorithms
     * for the heavily-traversed index lists than can be used for the
     * base lists.  Here's a picture of some of the basics for a
     * possible list with 2 levels of index:

     * The base lists use a variant of the HM linked ordered set
     * algorithm. See Tim Harris, "A pragmatic implementation of
     * non-blocking linked lists"
     * http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tlh20/publications.html and Maged
     * Michael "High Performance Dynamic Lock-Free Hash Tables and
     * List-Based Sets"
     * http://www.research.ibm.com/people/m/michael/pubs.htm.  The
     * basic idea in these lists is to mark the "next" pointers of
     * deleted nodes when deleting to avoid conflicts with concurrent
     * insertions, and when traversing to keep track of triples
     * (predecessor, node, successor) in order to detect when and how
     * to unlink these deleted nodes.
     *
     * Rather than using mark-bits to mark list deletions (which can
     * be slow and space-intensive using AtomicMarkedReference), nodes
     * use direct CAS'able next pointers.  On deletion, instead of
     * marking a pointer, they splice in another node that can be
     * thought of as standing for a marked pointer (see method
     * unlinkNode).  Using plain nodes acts roughly like "boxed"
     * implementations of marked pointers, but uses new nodes only
     * when nodes are deleted, not for every link.  This requires less
     * space and supports faster traversal. Even if marked references
     * were better supported by JVMs, traversal using this technique
     * might still be faster because any search need only read ahead
     * one more node than otherwise required (to check for trailing
     * marker) rather than unmasking mark bits or whatever on each
     * read.
     *
     * This approach maintains the essential property needed in the HM
     * algorithm of changing the next-pointer of a deleted node so
     * that any other CAS of it will fail, but implements the idea by
     * changing the pointer to point to a different node (with
     * otherwise illegal null fields), not by marking it.  While it
     * would be possible to further squeeze space by defining marker
     * nodes not to have key/value fields, it isn't worth the extra
     * type-testing overhead.  The deletion markers are rarely
     * encountered during traversal, are easily detected via null
     * checks that are needed anyway, and are normally quickly garbage
     * collected. (Note that this technique would not work well in
     * systems without garbage collection.)
     *
     * In addition to using deletion markers, the lists also use
     * nullness of value fields to indicate deletion, in a style
     * similar to typical lazy-deletion schemes.  If a node's value is
     * null, then it is considered logically deleted and ignored even
     * though it is still reachable.
     *
     * Here's the sequence of events for a deletion of node n with
     * predecessor b and successor f, initially:
     *
     *        +------+       +------+      +------+
     *   ...  |   b  |------>|   n  |----->|   f  | ...
     *        +------+       +------+      +------+
     *
     * 1. CAS n's value field from non-null to null.
     *    Traversals encountering a node with null value ignore it.
     *    However, ongoing insertions and deletions might still modify
     *    n's next pointer.
     *
     * 2. CAS n's next pointer to point to a new marker node.
     *    From this point on, no other nodes can be appended to n.
     *    which avoids deletion errors in CAS-based linked lists.
     *
     *        +------+       +------+      +------+       +------+
     *   ...  |   b  |------>|   n  |----->|marker|------>|   f  | ...
     *        +------+       +------+      +------+       +------+
     *
     * 3. CAS b's next pointer over both n and its marker.
     *    From this point on, no new traversals will encounter n,
     *    and it can eventually be GCed.
     *        +------+                                    +------+
     *   ...  |   b  |----------------------------------->|   f  | ...
     *        +------+                                    +------+
     *
     * A failure at step 1 leads to simple retry due to a lost race
     * with another operation. Steps 2-3 can fail because some other
     * thread noticed during a traversal a node with null value and
     * helped out by marking and/or unlinking.  This helping-out
     * ensures that no thread can become stuck waiting for progress of
     * the deleting thread.
     *
     * Skip lists add indexing to this scheme, so that the base-level
     * traversals start close to the locations being found, inserted
     * or deleted -- usually base level traversals only traverse a few
     * nodes. This doesn't change the basic algorithm except for the
     * need to make sure base traversals start at predecessors (here,
     * b) that are not (structurally) deleted, otherwise retrying
     * after processing the deletion.
     *
     * Index levels are maintained using CAS to link and unlink
     * successors ("right" fields).  Races are allowed in index-list
     * operations that can (rarely) fail to link in a new index node.
     * (We can't do this of course for data nodes.)  However, even
     * when this happens, the index lists correctly guide search.
     * This can impact performance, but since skip lists are
     * probabilistic anyway, the net result is that under contention,
     * the effective "p" value may be lower than its nominal value.
     *
     * Index insertion and deletion sometimes require a separate
     * traversal pass occurring after the base-level action, to add or
     * remove index nodes.  This adds to single-threaded overhead, but
     * improves contended multithreaded performance by narrowing
     * interference windows, and allows deletion to ensure that all
     * index nodes will be made unreachable upon return from a public
     * remove operation, thus avoiding unwanted garbage retention.
     *
     * Indexing uses skip list parameters that maintain good search
     * performance while using sparser-than-usual indices: The
     * hardwired parameters k=1, p=0.5 (see method doPut) mean that
     * about one-quarter of the nodes have indices. Of those that do,
     * half have one level, a quarter have two, and so on (see Pugh's
     * Skip List Cookbook, sec 3.4), up to a maximum of 62 levels
     * (appropriate for up to 2^63 elements).  The expected total
     * space requirement for a map is slightly less than for the
     * current implementation of java.util.TreeMap.
     *
     * Changing the level of the index (i.e, the height of the
     * tree-like structure) also uses CAS.  Creation of an index with
     * height greater than the current level adds a level to the head
     * index by CAS'ing on a new top-most head. To maintain good
     * performance after a lot of removals, deletion methods
     * heuristically try to reduce the height if the topmost levels
     * appear to be empty.  This may encounter races in which it is
     * possible (but rare) to reduce and "lose" a level just as it is
     * about to contain an index (that will then never be
     * encountered). This does no structural harm, and in practice
     * appears to be a better option than allowing unrestrained growth
     * of levels.
     *
     * This class provides concurrent-reader-style memory consistency,
     * ensuring that read-only methods report status and/or values no
     * staler than those holding at method entry. This is done by
     * performing all publication and structural updates using
     * (volatile) CAS, placing an acquireFence in a few access
     * methods, and ensuring that linked objects are transitively
     * acquired via dependent reads (normally once) unless performing
     * a volatile-mode CAS operation (that also acts as an acquire and
     * release).  This form of fence-hoisting is similar to RCU and
     * related techniques (see McKenney's online book
     * https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/perfbook/perfbook.html)
     * It minimizes overhead that may otherwise occur when using so
     * many volatile-mode reads. Using explicit acquireFences is
     * logistically easier than targeting particular fields to be read
     * in acquire mode: fences are just hoisted up as far as possible,
     * to the entry points or loop headers of a few methods. A
     * potential disadvantage is that these few remaining fences are
     * not easily optimized away by compilers under exclusively
     * single-thread use.  It requires some care to avoid volatile
     * mode reads of other fields. (Note that the memory semantics of
     * a reference dependently read in plain mode exactly once are
     * equivalent to those for atomic opaque mode.)  Iterators and
     * other traversals encounter each node and value exactly once.
     * Other operations locate an element (or position to insert an
     * element) via a sequence of dereferences. This search is broken
     * into two parts. Method findPredecessor (and its specialized
     * embeddings) searches index nodes only, returning a base-level
     * predecessor of the key. Callers carry out the base-level
     * search, restarting if encountering a marker preventing link
     * modification.  In some cases, it is possible to encounter a
     * node multiple times while descending levels. For mutative
     * operations, the reported value is validated using CAS (else
     * retrying), preserving linearizability with respect to each
     * other. Others may return any (non-null) value holding in the
     * course of the method call.  (Search-based methods also include
     * some useless-looking explicit null checks designed to allow
     * more fields to be nulled out upon removal, to reduce floating
     * garbage, but which is not currently done, pending discovery of
     * a way to do this with less impact on other operations.)
     *
     * To produce random values without interference across threads,
     * we use within-JDK thread local random support.
